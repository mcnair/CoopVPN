        <p>At LEAP we strongly believe in sharing of knowledge, there&rsquo;s no other way to develop code that LEAP uses other than open source, we&rsquo;ll forever keep our code open source, there will never be any secret sauce that LEAP employs in its stack, we believe that security by obscurity is a fallacy, we&rsquo;ll open source all our code except for &ldquo;secrets/credentials&rdquo; we want anyone to be able to replicate our stack, as part of this we&rsquo;ll always develop in the open and will try to remove any barriers to open collaborations to the extent that we&rsquo;ll mirror our code to capitalist entities like Github to ensure there&rsquo;s less friction for others to use our stack</p>
<p>All our new code will be licensed under the GPL license or licenses that are compatible with GPL, if we ever have to use MIT/BSD/Apache or other permissible license code we&rsquo;ll try our best to remove those dependencies and invest to create alternatives that are licensed under copy left</p>

<p><strong>Version 1.0</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>At LEAP, we reject the fallacy of &ldquo;security by obscurity.&rdquo; We believe that software sovereignty relies on the freedom to inspect, modify, and replicate the systems we depend on.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>No Secret Sauce:</strong> Every line of code running in our stack, from the client interface to the backend infrastructure, is public.</li>
<li><strong>Total Transparency:</strong> We develop in the open. Our internal repositories <em>are</em> our public repositories.</li>
<li><strong>Copyleft Maximalism:</strong> We prioritize the collective good over proprietary gain. We aggressively prefer Copyleft licensing to ensure improvements are permanently returned to the commons.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>// cyberta: tbh, I like the prompt text more than this generated section</em></p>
<p><em>// this is another attempt:</em></p>
<p><em>At <strong>LEAP</strong>, we believe that software sovereignty is built on the freedom to inspect, modify, and replicate the systems we rely on.</em></p>
<p><em>We are committed to keeping all our code open, with the exception of sensitive information such as secrets and credentials. This transparency empowers others to understand and replicate our technology stack, fostering trust and cultivating a vibrant community of developers and users.</em></p>
<p><em>To uphold this philosophy, we will continuously develop in the open and collaborate on our independent <strong>GitLab</strong> instances, while also mirroring our code on big tech platforms like <strong>GitHub</strong>. This approach ensures autonomy, removes barriers, and enhances visibility, allowing anyone to engage with our projects and contribute to our shared goals. Together, we strive to advance the capabilities of open-source technology.</em></p>

<p>jkito: the very first line can be simplified to just: “We require contributions to our project to use the  <strong>Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) 1.1</strong>. and instead of quoting the agreement text here we just link to the website (on a sidenote: we need CI to fail when DCO is not added)</p>
