        <p class="lead">Many VPNs make privacy claims they don’t back up. CoopVPN is built by the developers behind RiseupVPN, CalyxVPN, and TorVPN. We run a strict no-logs service, publish 100% of our code as open source, and have undergone independent security audits by Cure53 and SRLabs. Organizationally, CoopVPN is worker-owned, with ownership and privacy policies designed to prioritize user protection over profit.</p>

        <h2 class="h2">Why use a VPN?</h2>
        <p class="lead">Our online lives are circumscribed by two nefarious forces: surveillance capitalism and authoritarian nation states. These forces splinter the internet into smaller sub domains, their algorithms turning neighbors against each other for control and profit. The problem is global and existential. Using a good VPN will not end this, but it does give you and yours one level of protection against the prying eyes and data sucking networks that seek to monetize and control us. A VPN that you can trust is an important tool in the tool box of internet freedom.</p>

    <p class="lead center max-3xl">We offer two plans: a free plan and a faster paid plan with customer support. As a worker coop, we have no investors or bosses taking profits. Any profits are first reinvested in the coop; remaining funds are split 50% to worker-owners and 50% to a solidarity fund supporting allied providers and anti-censorship efforts.</p>

    <h2 class="h1 center">About us</h2>

    <div class="about-grid">
      <p class="lead">
        We are a team of privacy technologists, researchers, and activists with more than two decades of experience building and maintaining open-source tools for secure communication. Our contributors include fellows and alumni from respected digital rights and research communities such as Open Observatory of Network Interference, Lantern, and Citizen Lab, as well as contributors to the Tor Project. We are the core developers and maintainers of LEAP VPN, the open-source platform that powers CoopVPN, is deployed by partners such as Riseup, and was previously used by The Calyx Institute.We are a worker-owned cooperative. That means no outside investors, no growth or die incentives. 
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
        Guided by solidarity, we prioritize dignified labor, cooperation over competition, and technology that serves people rather than extracting from them. For years, the LEAP VPN stack has been sustained primarily through grants. While this support enabled important research and field testing of censorship-resistant technologies, it has not been a stable foundation. By launching a paid provider, we will have well-resourced infrastructure, create predictable funding for core development, faster updates, and the rapid deployment of new circumvention protocols. All improvements we make are released as open source and immediately benefit our partner providers as well. Most importantly, this model allows us to engage directly with users, respond quickly to real-world needs, and ensure the technology evolves in step with the people who depend on it.
